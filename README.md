<h2>Overview</h2>
Our company wants to add a progress tracker to our existing application. Progress tracking is
an expected feature of time management apps. The completion status of a user’s projects
should be stored in the database, and displayed on command.
This will help our users visualize their current projects and manage their time according to what
they still have to accomplish.
